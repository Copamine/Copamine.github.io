        <h1>controls</h1>  
        <p>
            the controls are quite simple:
            <br><br>
            a, A, and left arrow to go left
            <br>
            d, D, and right arrow to go right
            <br>
            w, W, and up arrow to jump
            <br>
            r to reset yourself to begining
            <br><br>
            and then theres \ for dev mode that just shows your coordinates at all times for those stupid little nerds (i need
          it to actually make the platforms, im not a stupid little nerd).
          <br><br>
            thats literally it.
        </p>

        <h1>game mechanics</h1>  
        <p>
            there are some silly little quirks to this game (most are bugs that i didnt care enough to fix so i turned them into features)
            <br><br>
            platforms:
            <br>
            when it comes to platforms, theres a couple different types. theres normal platforms (the normal brown looking ones),
            the teleport platforms (purple), and slippery platforms (blue).
            <br>normal platforms are just ones that if you go on top youll stand and if you hit the bottom you hit your head.
            <br>teleport platforms are a bit goofy. if you touch any part of these platforms (most parts, the hitboxes are buggy as hell),
            you will teleport on top of them instantly.
            <br>the slippery platforms are self explaining. you go on them, friction is bad. these things are really buggy though, but it
            makes the game harder, so im not fixing them.
            <br><br>
            theres also this silly thing (bug that i didnt wanna fix so its a cool mechanic now) called infinite coyote time. if you know what
            coyote time is, youd know its that little period of time in platformers where you can still jump even after you fell off.
            this game has that, but different. this game has <i>infinite</i> coyote time. when you walk off a platform without jumping, you
            can jump at any time after. the only quirk is that you can only jump once.
            <br><br>
            lastly, (another bug that im keeping), if you have too much downwards momentum, you will just flat out phase through platforms.
            this is because you move too fast for the game to realize youre on a platform, but it just adds to the unforgiving nature,
            so im keeping it. i might fix it eventually (ex. when the game gets too long to where having this is just unfair), but for now
            its a mechanic.
        </p>

        <h1>tips</h1>
        <p>
            tele-plats:
            <br><br>
            to restate, if you touch <i>anywhere</i> on these platforms, you go to the top. that means you can touch the side, bottom,
            literally anywhere, and youre on top. some jumps are impossible without this. keep an eye out for these purple platforms.
         
          <br><br>
          slippy-plats:
<br><br>
          these are slippery. i know, its crazy right? they are actually not buggy (they still are a little, but thats aside the point). 
          what they do now is that they have acceleration and friction, meaning that you have to hold the other direction
          to slow down faster, and to make most jumps you have to go to the end of the platform and speed up to max.
         
          <br><br>
         
          coyote time:

<br><br>
          this is VERY useful, and actually nessicary for some jumps (ex. the 5 jumps after the staircase). if a jump seems to far
          to be able to make, it probably requires coyote time. coyote time is infinite in this game. use this
          to your advantage
         
         
          <br><br>
         
         terminal velocity:
         <br><br>
         your terminal velocity is actually quite low, as you are very small compared to the world you live in.
         ill leave it up to you to figure out what that means. but basically, you can still move in the air, but 
         you fall (relativly) slow. use this to your advantage.
         <br><br>

  <h1>
    lore
    </h1>

    <p>
        yes, there is lore.
<br><br>
<b>origin</b>
<br><br>
Buare Kringlefrop, the son of Blue Kringlefrop and Square Kringlefrop (maiden name was 
Fitzgerald), is the player character. you control him to help him get to his final goal, 
the platform with the gray bar.

<br><br>
that is all i will say. the lore is planned out fully, but i will only tell you this. the rest you guys
have to figure out. have fun.

<br><br>

also, ORANGE CIRCLE IS NOT CANNON.
